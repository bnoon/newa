<p>Blossom blight infection risk is tracked by the accumulation of 4-day degree hour totals 
beginning at bloom. NEWA begins degree hour accumulation on the date of full pink or "first blossom open" for
McIntosh apple.</p>

<p>It is best if you enter your start date based on blossom dates in your apple or pear
orchards and re-calculate Cougarblight risk predictions.</p>

<P>Typically, the first few blossoms that open are a few days ahead of true first bloom because they are close 
to sunny large scaffolds or trunks. Fire blight bacteria are rarely active at the very early bloom time, so getting 
the "first blossom open" date exact is not critical.</p>

<p>Continue monitoring the fire blight risk predictions and watching your orchards for secondary bloom
because, although infection of secondary bloom may be less dangerous than that of primary bloom, infection 
of secondary bloom leads to continued high disease activity and higher risk in subsequent years.</p>
