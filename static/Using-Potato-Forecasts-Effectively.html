<p class="normal"><b>Potato disease forecasts are available for early blight and late blight.  If late blight risk is high in your area (late blight common in potatoes the previous year) or late blight is present, use the late blight forecast to schedule fungicide applications. Find more information about which fungicides are most effective against each disease in the <a href="https://store.cornell.edu/c-875-pmep-guidelines.aspx" target="_blank">Cornell Integrated Crop and Pest Management Guidelines for Commercial Vegetable Production</a>.</b></p>

<p class="normal"><b>Late Blight Forecasting:</b> Two late blight forecast systems are available on NEWA:  Blitecast and Simcast.  Both use temperature and relative humidity data, for a location of your choice, to calculate disease severity values or blight units that accumulate over time until a threshold is reached, indicating that a fungicide application is recommended.  Simcast also takes into account the effect of varietal resistance to late bight and fungicide active ingredient.  Blitecast is used to time the first fungicide application on potato, and Simcast is used to time subsequent fungicide applications.

<p class="normal"><b>Early Blight Forecasting:</b> Daily maximum and minimum temperatures are used to calculate P-Day values that accumulate as the season progresses.</p>

<p class="normal_head"><a name="ffung"></a>First Fungicide Application</p>
<p class="normal">On the <a  href="http://newa.cornell.edu/index.php?page=potato-late-blight">Potato Disease Forecast page</a>, select the weather station or airport closest to the field you are forecasting for, or another nearby that is more similar to weather conditions at this field. Click the &quot;no&quot; button to indicate that no fungicide has been applied. Choose a &quot;first potato tissue&quot; date that reflects the earliest potato foliage in your region (30 mile radius) that could be a source of late blight spores. Usually this is potatoes in cull piles, but could also be volunteer potatoes from tubers left in the field last year, or foliage from the seed you or your neighbors planted. The safest date to choose is the earliest date foliage emerges from any of these sources. Choose a crop emergence date for your fields to initiate the early blight forecast. Click on "get report" to see a table showing the forecast results.</p>

<p class="normal">Dates in the top row with a blue background indicate forecasts calculated from actual weather data collected at the weather station you chose. Dates with yellow are severity values based on forecast weather including rainfall. Those in orange are forecasts that donâ€™t include rainfall, so are not as accurate.  Data from National Weather Service forecasts for the weather station location you chose are used.</p>

<p class="normal">The <b>first fungicide application</b> will usually be triggered by the late blight forecast and should occur as soon as possible after 18 Blitecast severity values have accumulated since first potato tissue emergence in your region. Find more information on how severity values are calculated in Table 1 <a href="#table1">below</a>. When the 18 severity value threshold is reached or forecast, the background color of the box displaying the severity value number turns to red, indicating that a threshold has been reached. Apply a fungicide, as soon as you can after the threshold has been reached, to any potato fields with plants larger than six inches tall.</p>

<p class="normal_head"><a name="sfung"></a>Subsequent Fungicide Applications</p>
<p class="normal">Once you've applied your first fungicide, use Simcast or early blight P-Days to help schedule your fungicide applications for the remainder of the season.  Keep track of where late blight has been found by signing up for email or text alerts at <a href="http://usablight.org" target="_blank">usablight.org</a> web site to help determine the appropriate forecast to use. <b>If late blight is present in your region, use Simcast to schedule fungicide applications.</b> Because your own field may be the first late blight report in your area, the most conservative approach is to use Simcast to schedule protective fungicide applications.</p>

<p class="normal">On the <a href="http://newa.cornell.edu/index.php?page=potato-simcast">Potato Disease Forecast page</a> choose the appropriate weather station and &quot;yes&quot; to indicate that a fungicide has been applied. On the next page indicate your crop emergence date, the date of your most recent fungicide application, and your potato variety. If your variety does not appear on the drop-down menu, assume that it is susceptible and choose one of the susceptible varieties on the list as your variety. Then click &quot;Get report.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Simcast uses weather data to calculate Blight Units (indicating disease severity) and Fungicide Units (indicating fungicide weathering). Different thresholds for each are used for varieties that are more susceptible to late blight than varieties that are less susceptible. At present, chlorothalonil is assumed to be the fungicide applied. Other fungicide choices are available on the <a style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Times;" href="http://newa.cornell.edu/index.php?page=potato-late-blight-dss">BlightPro Decision Support System</a>.</p>

<p class="normal">On the reports page you will see blight units and P-Values increasing over time, and fungicide units decreasing over time, indicating fungicide residue being lost. Once a treatment threshold is reached, a change in cell color to red will signal that the threshold has been reached and a fungicide application is recommended.</p>

<p class="normal_head"><a name="general"></a>General information on interpreting disease forecasts</p>
<p class="normal">Because weather conditions can vary depending on topography and altitude, the recent disease information and disease forecasts will be most accurate very close to the weather station used. For locations that are not close to a weather station, forecast information should only be used as a <b>*general indication*</b> of how favorable weather has been for late blight. </p>

<p class="normal">Keep in mind that disease forecasts based on forecast weather data are subject to change as the weather forecast changes. Check back in regularly to see if disease forecasts have changed.</p>

<p class="normal">Knowing the location of the weather station, and thinking about how temperature and humidity conditions at the station differ from particular fields on your farm can help you interpret forecast information. For example, if the weather station closest to you is in a valley that tends to dry off slowly compared to your farm, the forecast information would tend to be relatively conservative for your location. If a weather station location is in an open area that would tend to dry off quickly relative to your fields, then the forecast information from that location would indicate that conditions had been less favorable for late blight than they were at your farm.</p>

<p class="normal">Comparing the amount of rain that fell at the weather station site with the amount that fell on your farm can also help you determine how similar weather conditions have been at the two locations. If rain is forecast, be sure that all foliage has received a fungicide application within the last 7 days, especially if late blight has been found in the region. Late blight spores may be carried on storm fronts, and if large numbers of spores are deposited on unprotected tissue, a lot of infections can get started.</p>

<p class="normal"><b>*Overhead Irrigation*</b> can create late blight favorable conditions in a field that weather stations will not be taking into account. Irrigation that starts when the leaves are still wet from dew in the morning, or continues after dew has fallen at night will extend the wetting period for that day. The <a href="http://newa.cornell.edu/index.php?page=potato-late-blight-dss">BlightPro Decision Support System</a> allows users to include leaf wetness from irrigation in the Simcast Blight Unit and Fungicide Unit calculations.</p>

<p class="normal_head">Blitecast Details</p>
<p class="normal">The first possible appearance of late blight (caused by <i>Phytophthora infestans</i>), and periods of late blight favorable weather can be predicted using relative humidity and temperature data collected from a weather station. The weather data is converted into units called &quot;Severity Values&quot; (SV) for the purpose of predicting late blight as shown in Table 1. </p>

<p class="normal">Late blight is first expected to appear no earlier than 1-2 weeks after 18 SV have accumulated since emergence of susceptible green tissue in the region. The source of inoculum could be plants growing from infected tubers in a cull pile, volunteers growing from infected tubers that survived the winter, or infected seed tubers. The first green tissue is most likely to be emerging from any potato cull piles in your region, so it's best to use that date. </p>

<p class="normal_head">Simcast Details</p>
<p class="normal">Simcast is a late blight disease forecaster that predicts the need for a fungicide spray once fungicide applications have begun.  It considers three of the most important factors affecting late blight: weather, host resistance, and fungicide active ingredient and weathering.  Each of these factors is considered in determining the need for another fungicide spray. The effect of weather (temperature and relative humidity) is quantified in terms of &quot;Blight Units&quot;. The decline of fungicide residue in the canopy over time is quantified in terms of &quot;Fungicide Units&quot;.   Host resistance is a factor because infection occurs more readily on susceptible plants than on more resistant plants. In Simcast there are three categories of plants in relation to their reaction to late blight: susceptible, moderately susceptible, and moderately resistant. Each category  has unique &quot;Blight Unit&quot; and &quot;Fungicide Unit&quot; thresholds for suggesting an additional fungicide spray.   The thresholds are defined such that a fungicide spray is recommended more frequently for a susceptible cultivar than for a more resistant cultivar.</p>

<p class="normal_head">Early Blight Forecast Details</p>
<p class="normal">A unit called P-Days is used for early blight forecasting.
In recent years late blight has driven the potato fungicide application program. Generally a fungicide application schedule driven by late blight will result in control of early blight caused by <i>Alternaria solani</i> if the fungicide active ingredient is also effective against early blight. There may be situations where late blight is a less serious problem for growers, with the result that growers should be concerned about possible problems from early blight.</p>

<p class="normal">The P-Days system was developed in Wisconsin. The system is based on temperature and the fact that fungicides applied for early blight do not usually show benefit until after the crop begins to flower.</p>

<p class="normal">Fungicide applications are recommended to begin for early blight control at <b>300 P-Day</b> values.</p>

<p class="normal">In some cases where the field may have potatoes for the second year in a row or where there is a strong field history of early dying, you may want to adjust the threshold to between <b>200 and 300 P-Days</b>.</p>
