<h2>Apple Carbohydrate Thinning Model</h2>
<p>
The Cornell apple carbohydrate thinning model was developed by Alan Lakso at Cornell University and adapted for practical use by Terence Robinson at Cornell University.  The model, using fundamental tree physiology, estimates over a season from bud break the carbohydrate production by an apple tree with a set description and the total demands for growth for both the crop and the tree growth.  It calculates a balance of supply to demand each day of the season using the weather data that is entered from the chosen weather station.</p>
 
<p>It should be noted that the model does not attempt to model any specific variety or training system.  The general carbohydrate balance it calculates has been found to correlate well with tree sensitivity to natural drop and with sensitivity to chemical thinners.   Cool sunny periods of good carbohydrate supply leads to reduced natural drop and less response to thinners.  Cloudy hot periods give carbohydrate deficits and lead to stronger natural drop and stronger response to thinners.  The four-day running average is used since studies and observations have shown that the apple tree does not respond to just one or two days of good or bad weather, but has a capacity to respond more slowly to changes in weather.</p>

<p>The thinning recommendations given for each date are based on the forecasted carbohydrate balance over the next 4 days in the future. Thus if a spray is applied today, the weather over the next 4 days is taken into account when giving a thinning recommendation.  The thinning recommendations are based on the best research available and are given as a guide to help define the proper rate of hormone type thinning chemicals (NAA, BA and Carbaryl) when sprayed with a given carbohydrate status.  However, since they are based on forecasted weather and biological systems which we don't completely understand they are inherently imprecise. Users of the carbohydrate model should use the recommendations at their own risk.  Cornell University is not responsible for the actual outcome of thinning sprays which are influenced by many additional variables including individual spraying methods.</p>
