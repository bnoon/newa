<div style="width:100%;"> <h3 style="margin-top:0; text-align:center;">How to use Onion Disease Forecasts</h3> 

<h4>QUICK START</h4>
<p>Please read the more detailed information below for a better
understanding of the disease forecasts, but as a quick start ask yourself:

<p><b>Is the disease present in my field?</b></p>

<p><b>If the disease is present:</b> 

<ul>
<li>How favorable were conditions for the past 7 days?

<p>If extremely or moderately favorable, choose a fungicide effective against that disease.  See
<a href="http://rvpadmin.cce.cornell.edu/uploads/doc_319.pdf" target="_blank">
http://rvpadmin.cce.cornell.edu/uploads/doc_319.pdf</a> for information on choosing the most effective
fungicides.

<li>How favorable are current and forecast conditions?

<p>If the disease is forecast to be over threshold for more than three days, be sure fungicide
coverage is maintained.

<p>If the disease is not forecast to be over threshold, you may be able to delay fungicide
applications.  Do not extend spray intervals for more than 10 days and continue to monitor
forecasts.  Be sure to apply a fungicide before very favorable weather occurs.
</ul>

<p><b>If the disease is not present,</b> but conditions have been favorable, scout carefully to
determine if the disease has appeared in your field.  As new diseases are detected, adjust fungicide
programs to include products that are effective against the mix of diseases that are present.  See

fungicides.

<h4>THE IMPORTANCE OF SCOUTING</h4> 
<p>While disease forecasting can be a useful component of your
disease management program, it should <b>only be used with a regular scouting program.</b>  Disease
forecasts are not a substitute for scouting.

<h4>USING ONION DISEASE FORECASTS EFFECTIVELY</h4> 
<p>Weather-based disease forecasts are available
for three fungal diseases of onions: Botrytis leaf blight (caused by Botrytis squamosa) purple
blotch (caused by Alternaria porri) and downy mildew (caused by Peronospora destructor).  There are
separate forecasting programs for each disease.  Each of the three diseases needs to be taken into
account when using the forecasts to determine fungicide spray programs.

<p><b>General information </b>
<p>The <b>"Number of days favorable"</b> and <b>"Average rating per day"</b>
under the "Past 7 Days" heading gives a general indication of disease pressure using the color guide
below the results chart.  The <b>"Today"</b> and <b>5-Day forecast</b> area will be red if it is over threshold
and green if the forecast is not over threshold.

<p>Disease pressure, current forecast information plus scouting results and the days since the last
fungicide application should all be taken into account when deciding on a fungicide application.  In
general expect 7 days of protection from a fungicide application.  If more than an inch of rain has
fallen, assume that you've lost the protection from the last fungicide application.

<p><b>Fungicide choice</b> will depend on which diseases have been detected in the field and how favorable
conditions are for disease.  When conditions are extremely favorable, fungicides with the best
performance for the disease should be selected, or the highest label rate used when there is a range
of rates.  See <a href="http://rvpadmin.cce.cornell.edu/uploads/doc_319.pdf" target="_blank">
http://rvpadmin.cce.cornell.edu/uploads/doc_319.pdf</a> for information on choosing the
most effective fungicides.

<p>When conditions are not favorable for a disease, less emphasis may be placed on controlling it,
provided scouting information confirms that the disease is at low levels.

<p><b>Botrytis Leaf Blight Forecasts </b>
<p>There are two different disease forecasts available for Botrytis leaf blight; Modified Blight Alert, 
developed in New York by Dr. Paul Vincelli and Dr. Jim Lorbeer
at Cornell University, and the Michigan Botrytis Forecast developed by Dr. Mel Lacey at Michigan
State University.  Blight Alert was developed in New York and is the most appropriate forecast to
use for New York conditions.  The Michigan forecast can help with scheduling early season scouting
and provide additional information to use when making a spray decision for Botrytis.

<p><b>Michigan Botrytis forecast </b>
<p>The Michigan Botrytis forecast predicts the release of Botrytis
spores.  The forecast indicates whether there was a significant inoculum potential when the <b>BLB
value is 50 or higher.</b> A significant inoculum potential indicates that spores have been released and that there is a
risk of infection.

<p>This model is a good early season warning system to determine if blight conditions exist prior to
scouting.  It is also a good indicator for scheduling the first scouting of the season.

<p><b>Modified Blight Alert </b>
<p>A <b>combination of scouting, thresholds and weather-based forecasts</b> is used to
determine fungicide programs for Botrytis leaf blight using Blight Alert.

<p>The first fungicide is applied when scouting determines that there is an average of one Botrytis
lesion per leaf, the <b>Inoculum production index (IPI) is 7 or greater,</b> and there is a 30% or greater
chance of rain.  See the Cornell Integrated Crop and Pest Management Guidelines for Commercial
Vegetable Production for information on scouting.

<p>Subsequent applications are determined by how favorable past weather has been and how many days
are forecast to be over threshold in the future, keeping in mind that fungicide protection is gone
if more than one inch of rain has fallen since the last application. When Modified Blight Alert indicates 
very favorable for 5-7 days, than BLB needs to be actively managed when the disease is present in the crop.

<p>In general, when both Modified Blight Alert and Michigan Botrytis Forecast models are indicating favorable 
conditions, than disease pressure is higher than if just one disease model is predicting actionable disease 
pressure.  When this occurs, effective fungicides for BLB should be applied.

<p><b>Downy Mildew Forecast </b>
<p>The downy mildew forecast (DOWNCAST) was developed in Ontario, Canada by
Dr. P.D. Hildebrand and Dr. J. C. Sutton at the University of Guelph.  DOWNCAST predicts sporulation
of Peronopora destructor,the fungus that causes downy mildew, <b>if it is present.</b>

<p>The forecast indicates whether the weather was favorable or unfavorable for sporulation. 
Occasional favorable days in areas where downy mildew has not been reported are not cause for
concern or special fungicide applications, but are a heads-up to look for downy mildew when
scouting.

<p>Because the downy mildew forecast includes rainfall in the calculations, only two days of
forecast is available.  The national weather service does not include rainfall in forecasts more
than two days out.

<p>If longer periods of greater than 5 out of 7 days of favorable weather have occurred, especially
once downy mildew is present, maintain
excellent coverage with protectant fungicides and scout fields carefully for downy mildew, which can
be very destructive.

<p>Finding downy mildew in your field or the immediate vicinity would be cause for switching to
specific fungicides targeting downy mildew. . See <a href="http://rvpadmin.cce.cornell.edu/uploads/doc_319.pdf" target="_blank">
http://rvpadmin.cce.cornell.edu/uploads/doc_319.pdf</a> for information on choosing the most effective fungicides.

<p><b>Alternaria Purple Blotch Forecast </b>
<p>The Alternaria forecast was developed in Michigan by Dr. Mel
Lacey.  Dr. Brian Cortwright and Christy Hoepting have been working to fine tune the forecast.  The
forecast uses temperature and relative humidity information to calculate a predictive index (PRI)
that predicts the release of Alternaria porri  (purple blotch) spores.  <b>A PRI of 5.7 or greater
indicates a high risk of purple blotch infection.</b>  A PRI less than 5.7 indicates a low risk.

<p><b>Stemphylium leaf blight </b>
<p>Since Stemphylium leaf blight (SLB) is favored by very similar
conditions as purple blotch, the purple blotch disease forecast may also serve as an indication of
when conditions are favorable for SLB. SLB also appears to be related to plant stress; healthy plants 
are less prone to SLB despite favorable conditions.

<p>Generally, once bulbing commences, onion plants appear to be more prone to SLB and Purple Blotch; 
typically fungicides with activity against these diseases commence at this time (July).
