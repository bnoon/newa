<p class="normal_head">Choosing a weather station</p>
<p class="normal">Select the weather station closest to the field you are forecasting for or a nearby one that is more similar to conditions at this field. If you're interested in purchasing a weather station for your farm see information <a href="http://newa.cornell.edu/index.php?page=get-weather-station" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p class="normal_head">First fungicide application</p>
<p class="normal">There are three ways to help time your first fungicide application in tomatoes.</p>
<ol class="normal">
<li>Use the Blitecast forecast. Choose an emergence date that reflects the earliest potato foliage in your area. Usually this is potatoes in cull piles, but could also be volunteer potatoes from tubers left in the field last year, or foliage from the seed you or your neighbors planted. The safest date to choose is the earliest date foliage emerges from any of these sources. Apply the first fungicide within one week after reaching a Severity Value (SV) accumulation of 18. This is the safest, most conservative approach, but most years will result in the highest number of fungicide applications
<li>Keep track of late blight reports on the <a href="http://usablight.org" target="_blank">usablight.org</a> web site and begin fungicide applications when late blight has been reported in your county or an adjacent county.  The risk involved with this approach is that the first late blight report in your area may be yours!
<li>If late blight is not present in your area, use TOMCAST to determine your first spray.  TOMCAST forecasts Septoria leaf spot, early blight, and anthracnose. See below for more on using TOMCAST.
</ol>

<p class="normal_head">Subsequent fungicide applications</p>
<p class="normal">If late blight is present in your area, use the SIMCAST forecast on NEWA or the <a href="http://newa.cornell.edu/index.php?page=potato-late-blight-dss" target="_blank">Late Blight Decision Support System (DSS)</a> to help time fungicide applications for the season.  If late blight is not present, TOMCAST may be used.  See more information on these forecasts below.</p>

<p class="normal_head">Timing fungicide applications for early blight, Septoria leaf spot, and Anthracnose</p>
<p class="normal">A system of weather-based disease forecasting called TOMCAST, developed by Dr. Ron Pitblado at the Ridgetown College of Agricultural Technology in Ontario, Canada, can be used to time fungicide applications for three fungal diseases; early blight (caused by <i>Alternaria solani</i>), Septoria leaf spot (caused by <i>Septoria lycopersici</i>), and fruit anthracnose (caused by <i>Colletotrichum coccodes</i>). If late blight is present in your county or adjacent counties, or conditions are present for movement of spores into your area, use the <a class="normal" href="http://newa.cornell.edu/index.php?page=potato-simcast">Simcast</a> late blight forecast system to time fungicide applications.</p>

<p class="normal"><strong>IMPORTANT CAUTIONARY NOTE:</strong></p>
<p class="normal"><strong>TOMCAST is not useful on farms that have a history of bacterial diseases. If you commonly have problems with bacterial spot, speck, or canker in your tomatoes, you should not use TOMCAST because the recommended spray intervals will not be sufficient for control of bacterial diseases if you're tank-mixing copper with your fungicide applications.  Find information about reducing bacterial diseases here: <a href="http://extension.psu.edu/plants/vegetable-fruit/news/2015/farming-like-you-expect-bacterial-diseases" target="_blank">http://extension.psu.edu/plants/vegetable-fruit/news/2015/farming-like-you-expect-bacterial-diseases</a></strong></p>

<p class="normal">TOMCAST uses leaf wetness and temperature data to calculate disease severity values (DSV's) as shown in Table 1.</p>
<p class="normal">To use TOMCAST, start accumulating DSVs when the tomatoes are transplanted. The first fungicide application should occur when <b>25 DSV's</b> have accumulated since transplanting. </p>
<p class="normal">If 25 DSV&rsquo;s have not accumulated before July 11, apply the first fungicide at that time*. </p>
<p class="normal">Subsequent applications should occur when <b>18-22 DSV's</b> have accumulated since the previous application if Bravo or Quadris are used, or <b>15 DSV&rsquo;s</b> if mancozeb fungicides are used. </p>
<p class="normal">If spray intervals extend more than 14 days using TOM-CAST, and the weather forecast calls for rain, apply a fungicide and allow it time to dry before the onset of rain. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="normal" style="font-style:italic;">* The July 11 date may not make sense for very late transplanted fields. Use your best judgement to determine the best time for the first fungicide application if DSV&rsquo;s are accumulating very slowly. Rapidly enlarging fruit or any early blight symptoms would be reasons to start fungicide applications.</p>

<p class="normal_head"><a name="simcast"></a>Timing Fungicide Applications for Late Blight using Simcast</p>
<p class="normal">Simcast uses weather data to calculate Blight Units (indicating disease severity) and Fungicide Units (indicating fungicide weathering), which accumulate to a threshold level that takes cultivar resistance into account.  At present, chlorothalonil is assumed to be the fungicide applied.  Other fungicides are available now on the <a href="http://blight.eas.cornell.edu/blight/" target="_blank">Decision Support System</a>, which is preferred for late blight forecasting.</p>
<p class="normal">On the <a class="normal" href="http://newa.cornell.edu/index.php?page=potato-simcast">Simcast page</a>, choose a weather station, indicate the date of your last fungicide application, and choose your variety.  If the variety you're growing doesn't appear on the list, it's safest to assume that it is fully susceptible.  Click on the &quot;tomato cultivar susceptibility&quot; link to find a susceptible variety to choose.  Once you've provided the three requested pieces of information, click the &quot;get report&quot; button.</p>
<p class="normal">On the reports page you can see blight units increasing over time, and fungicide units decreasing over time, indicating fungicide residue being lost.  Dates that display forecasts based on actual weather data are indicated in blue in the top row.  Forecast weather is indicated by gold for forecasts that include rainfall, and brown for forecasts that don't include rainfall.  The National Weather Service only forecasts rainfall three days into the future.</p>
<p class="normal">Once a treatment threshold is reached, for either Blight Units or Fungicide Units, a change in report cell color to red will signal that the threshold has been reached.</p>
<p class="normal_head">General information on interpreting disease forecasts</p>
<p class="normal">Because weather conditions can vary depending on topography and altitude, the forecast information will be most accurate very close to a weather monitor. For locations that are not close to a weather monitor, forecast information should only be used as a *<strong>general indication</strong>* of how favorable weather has been for disease.</p>
<p class="normal">Knowing the location of the monitor, and thinking about how temperature and humidity conditions at the monitor differ from particular fields on your farm can help you interpret forecast information. For example, if the weather monitor closest to you is in a valley that tends to dry off slowly compared to your farm, the forecast information would tend to be relatively conservative for your location. If a weather monitor location is in an open area that would tend to dry off quickly relative to your fields, then the forecast information from that location would indicate that conditions had been less favorable for disease than they were at your farm.</p>
<p class="normal">Comparing the amount of rain that fell at the weather monitor site with the amount that fell on your farm can also help you determine how similar weather conditions have been at the two locations. If rain is forecast, be sure that all foliage has received a fungicide application within the last 7 days, especially if plants are still growing rapidly and late blight has been found in the area. Late blight spores can be carried on storm fronts, and if large numbers of spores are deposited on unprotected tissue, a lot of infections can get started.</p>
<p class="normal"><strong>*Overhead Irrigation*</strong> can create disease favorable conditions in a field that a weather monitor will not be taking into account. Irrigation that starts when the leaves are still wet from dew in the morning, or continues after dew has fallen at night will extend the wetting period for that day and must be taken into consideration when weekly severity value accumulations are calculated. The <a href="http://newa.cornell.edu/index.php?page=potato-late-blight-dss" target="_blank">Late Blight Decision Support System (DSS)</a> allows users to include leaf wetness from irrigation in the Simcast blight unit and fungicide unit calculations.</p>
