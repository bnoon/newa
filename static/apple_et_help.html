<h2>Apple Irrigation Model</h2>
<p>
The apple ET model was developed at Cornell University due to inadequacies in our climate in the standard method. The standard method estimates apple water use as a fraction of the water use of a standard reference grass, adjusting seasonally for relative canopy development.  The grass model, calculated by an equation (called the Penman-Monteith equation) based on the physics of evaporating surfaces like a grass, is strongly controlled by sunlight radiation but not very sensitive to temperature and humidity.  Apple tree water use, however, for complex reasons is much more sensitive to temperature and humidity.</p>
 
<p>In humid climates where we can have days of similar sunlight radiation but greatly different temperatures and humidities, the standard method gives some large errors.  Consequently, it was felt necessary to adapt the Penman-Monteith equation directly for apple rather than relating apple to grass which is a poor model of apples.</p>
 
<p>Also, the apple model is a general model and does not take into account variations in soil characters, tree conditions (except for young trees) or cultural practices.  It runs on weather data from the selected weather station that may or may not be representative of any specific orchard, especially in rainfall.  Please use it with these precautions in mind.  The model was tested against direct measurements in New York, but will be continuously tested and refined over time.
