<b>Notes on Dew Calculation</b>

<p>Dew formation is estimated using temperature and relative humidity data. These variables are 
used to compute the dewpoint temperature. If the difference between the actual temperature and dewpoint temperature is
3&deg;F or less, the model assumes that dew has formed on plant surfaces. The exception is if rainfall occurred during the
same hour, in which case dew is not assumed to have occurred. If dew is believed to have formed in at least one hour during the course 
of the day in question, the result "Yes" will be displayed in the table, otherwise "No" will be displayed. </p>

<b>Notes of Relative Humidity Data Adjustments</b>

<p>Relative humidity (RH) data recorded at airport weather stations are usually not representative of conditions in an agricultural setting.
Therefore, RH values observed at airports are adjusted in an attempt to make them more applicable for agricultural applications. NWS RH forecast values are 
also adjusted in the same way for all locations. The formula used for these adjustments is: adjRH = RH / (0.0047*RH + 0.53). 
This can be expressed graphically as:
