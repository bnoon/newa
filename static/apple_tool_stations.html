<h2>Note regarding inclusion of stations in NEWA Apple Tools</h2>
<p>
The weather stations on the map and in the "Select station" drop-down list are those that have solar radiation data within range.  Stations not included have solar radiation data that is either too low or too high, i.e. out-of-range.  If your station is not listed, check on the following:
<ul>
<li>Make sure your solar radiation sensor is not shaded by any obstructions, such as nearby trees or buildings.
<li>Contact the weather station company (i.e. Rainwise) to have your weather station calibrated.
<li>If a Rainwise station was recently installed, make sure to enable the solar radiation sensor on your Rainwise.net page. On the Administration tab, at the bottom of the page, click the Solar and Leaf wetness radio buttons to enable these data and save your settings.
</ul>
</p>

Solar radiation data for airport weather stations are estimated using a model developed by the Northeast Regional Climate Center (<a href="http://www.nrcc.cornell.edu/services/research/reports/RR_93-4.html">model documentation</a>).
