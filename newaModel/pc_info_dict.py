PC activity is highly dependent upon temperatures, particularly at night when adults are most active.  PC usually do not feed or oviposit when nighttime temperatures are below 50 deg F.   If the weather is extremely warm after petal fall, the oviposition cycle may be completed in 2 weeks.  In cooler seasons, PC may continue to oviposit for 4-6 weeks.",
                               'management': "A petal fall spray should control plum curculio (PC) for about 10-14 days.  Incidence of observed PC damage is highly variable among different orchards.  PC damage usually occurs primarily along the edges of commercial orchards, and noticeable damage occurs in the same locations in orchards year after year, regardless of treatment levels.  Therefore, the potential for damage in any particular orchard can be predicted from past observations.  Usually, a post-petal fall spray for control of PC is not necessary in low-pressure orchards in which no damage has been observed in the past.  In high-pressure orchards, additional sprays along the perimeter of the orchards should be applied until the oviposition model predicts that control is no longer necessary.",
