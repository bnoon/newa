A reminder - under NY conditions, berries are <a href='/grapes/blackrot_var_table.html' target='_blank'>highly susceptible</a> to black rot from cap fall until 3-4 weeks (Concord) or 4-5 weeks (Riesling, Chardonnay) later, gradually losing susceptibility and finally becoming highly resistant after another 2 weeks."},

Keep track of infections events and maintain fungicide protection accordingly. Concords can become infected up to 6 weeks after the last cap has fallen, and <i>V. vinifera</i> varieties up through 7 weeks postbloom."},

If black rot symptoms are visible on leaves or fruit, this second post-bloom application is potentially critical if infection events are being logged and forecasted. Virtually complete control has been provided in the vast majority of vineyards when the bloom sprays have been followed by the second postbloom application. Fruit become highly resistant about 5-8 weeks after bloom, depending on <a href='/grapes/blackrot_var_table.html' target='_blank'>the variety</a> and year. In general, <i>Labrusca</i> fruit appear to become resistant about 1-2 weeks earlier than <i>V. vinifera</i> varieties. "},

                  'management': "Berries become highly resistant to infection by about 5 (Concord) to 7 (<i>V. vinifera</i>) weeks after the start of bloom. Experience has shown that it is usually possible to end black rot spray programs after the second postbloom application IF the disease has been well managed until then. Scout vineyards for black rot. If black rot symptoms are visible on fruit, fungicide protection to cover infection events through July may be necessary to limit disease spread within clusters. "},
