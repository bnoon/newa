     'management': "The period of high risk of blossom blight infection (20% bloom to 80% petal fall) has passed. If bloom is still present in your orchard, recalculate blossom blight risk by entering a first blossom open date. 1-2 weeks after petal fall, scout orchards for shoot blight, including rootstock sucker infections. Prune and remove infected shoots 12 inches below the infected margin during cool, dry weather. Pruning is particularly useful when blossom blight is well controlled and canker blight infections are thus the main source of inoculum for disease spread during the summer. Pruning can help limit disease spread, but will be most effective if practiced rigorously during the first few weeks after bloom; pruning will do little to slow disease spread if delayed until a large number of infections are visible. Routine use of antibiotics to prevent shoot blight spread during the summer is not effective or recommended. However, applications to protect new wounds immediately following a hailstorm can be very beneficial; check current recommendations."},
