<h3 style="margin-top:0; text-align:center;">About Onion Maggot</h3>
<p>Onion maggot (OM) is a serious pest of onion and related Allium crops like leek and garlic.  Only
the larvae cause damage to plants, by feeding on the basal plate and roots of plants.  It completes
three generations per season in Northern regions.  All three generations can cause damage, but the
overwintering generation emerging in the spring is the most destructive, potentially reducing stands
by over 50% if plants are not protected.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;">Life Cycle</h3>
<p>Onion maggot overwinters in the soil in the pupal stage.  Overwintering generation adults begin
to emerge in early May and flights peak in late May - early June, depending on temperatures.  Adult
females begin to lay eggs at the base of plants about 7-10 days after they emerge, and larvae hatch,
burrow into the soil, and begin feeding on the basal plate or roots.  Damaged seedlings
wilt, become flaccid, then die.  Larvae will move from dead plants to adjacent plants.  The
subsequent or first generation of larvae can cause damage and distortion in developing bulbs. The last
or second generation feeds on mature onion bulbs rendering them unmarketable and more susceptible to 
pathogens that can invade damaged tissue, causing problems in storage.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;">Management</h3>
<p>Rotating onions as far as possible from the previous season's crop can reduce OM populations and
damage.  Removing cull onions from the field at the end of the season can also reduce overwintering
populations.  Insecticide treated seed or in-furrow drenches at planting to protect young plants from
larval damage are the most commonly used options for OM control.  Targeting adults with a foliar
insecticide is not an effective management option.  The pieces are in place for treated seed that
would be allowed for organic production, but they are not currently on the market. Organic growers
with persistent OM problems can use floating row covers or netting to protect seedlings or
transplants from the overwintering generation of egg-laying females and should practice crop rotation. 
Pay attention to the forecast for first adult emergence and be sure row covers are in place before 
flies emerge. Adults can survive for 2-4 weeks after emergence, so keep row covers in place for at 
least 3 weeks after the overwintering flight peak. The first and second generation only rarely cause 
damage so it is not necessary to replace row covers for the first and second generation.</p>
