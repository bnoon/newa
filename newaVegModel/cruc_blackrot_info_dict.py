'keychar_o':  "Black rot is caused by a seed-borne and systemic bacterium. The classic systemic symptoms are wilted, pale green tissue becoming yellow then brown. Lesions from leaf margin infections are usually wedge- or V-shaped, enlarging as the disease progresses. Severely affected leaves may drop off. Bacteria can spread by wind-driven rain and enter leaves through leaf margins, wounds, and insect damage. Infected veins become black and are visible in leaf lesions and can be seen in infected leaf petioles, stems, and roots by cutting crosswise through affected tissue. Infected cabbage heads are more susceptible to secondary infections in storage. This disease is also known as blight, black stem, black vein, stem rot, stump rot, and leaf spot.</p>",

Some seed companies offer hot water treated seeds and guarantee the percentage of viable seeds, although some desired cultivars are not available in seed treated condition. Seed can be tested for pathogens at private laboratories such as STA Laboratories. If seed is from an unknown source or from known infested plants, hot water treatment may reduce the inoculum in and on the seed.  Soak broccoli and cauliflower seed for 20 minutes in 122&deg;F water, 25 minutes for Brussels sprouts and cabbage. This treatment may reduce germination and vigor and may not eradicate the pathogen from heavily infested lots. To test seed vigor, send samples to the New York State Seed Testing Laboratory. Seed can also be tested by contacting the Georgia Department of Agriculture, Plant Industry Division, Capital Square, Albany, GA 30344. <p>Seed testing lab sites: <ul><li><a href='http://www.stalabs.com/' target='_blank'>STA Laboratories</a> <li><a href='http://www.nysaes.cornell.edu/hort/seedlab/service.htm' target='_blank'>New York State Seed Testing Laboratory</a><li><a href='http://www.agr.georgia.gov/portal/site/AGR/menuitem.2f54fa407984c51e93f35eead03036a0/?vgnextoid062f733860a06210VgnVCM100000bf01020aRCRD' target='_blank'>Georgia Department of Agriculture</a></ul></p> <p>Many varieties have some level of tolerance to black rot.

Select a well drained field. Avoid fields near hedgerows or woods where air movement is restricted. Plant rows in the direction of the prevailing winds to promote quick drying of plants and soil. Land for seedbeds and late-season crops should not be near those fields used for early-season crops to minimize the movement of pathogens from old to young plants.</p>",
