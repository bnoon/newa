'keychar_o':  "Swede midge feeds on cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts as well as many other brassicas. Adults emerge from pupae in the spring and are tiny (1.5-2 mm) light brown flies identifiable only with special training. These weak fliers can be blown from field to field on light winds. During their short lives (3 to 4 days), females lay clusters of microscopic eggs in the growing tip of young plants or shoots. Larvae are small maggots initially about 0.3 mm in length before reaching their final size of 3 to 4 mm. They are lemon yellow at maturity. Up to 4 to 5 generations can occur annually. Pupae have survived in soils for over a year.</p> <p><b>Relative risk:</b> Swede midge is a new and increasing threat to brassicas in New York. It will be especially problematic on farms where rotation out of brassicas is not practiced and on organic farms since extensive laboratory tests have not identified any effective organic products. Brassicas can tolerate low populations, but if allowed to build, damage can be serious enough to result in areas where they can no longer be grown as seen in parts of Ontario, Canada. Growing tips may become distorted by larval feeding and produce several growing tips or none at all. Young leaves may become swollen, crinkled or crumpled. Brown scarring may be seen on the leaf petioles or stems and galls may form on flowers and leaves. Damage is most severe on broccoli but Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and red cabbage are also prone to Swede Midge.</p>",

                           'management_o': "Resistant varieites - Broccoli is the most susceptible crop. The broccoli variety, Paragon, consistently sustains high levels of swede midge damage. Eureka and Packman are also susceptible. Cauliflower and Brussels sprouts appear to be more susceptible than cabbage, with red cabbage being more susceptible than green cabbage although heavy infestations can cause damage in all cole crops.</p> <p>Site selection - Damage tends to be most severe in sheltered areas such as near hedges or in fields surrounded by brassica weeds where midges overwinter. The swede midge prefers moist soils.</p> <p>Barrier crops - Isolating the crop through growing tall barriers of a non-host crop such as sorghum Sudan or sweet corn, may reduce infestations from these low flying insects in small, isolated plantings.</p> <p>Planting - Planting brassica crops early in the season can reduce damage levels and population growth provided the field was not planted to cole crops the previous fall. The first generation of SM emerges in mid to late May in New York. Planting brassicas early allows young plants to grow past the most susceptible early stages of growth before SM populations begin to build. Target a mid-July harvest date when SM populations are highest. Avoid late season plantings to help to reduce the overwintering population of pupae in the soil. This strategy will not work for long season cole crops like Brussels sprouts. Infested transplants can provide an avenue of contamination for the farm. Use transplants grown in the Northeast or other cool season areas.</p> <p>Crop rotation - Due to the short life cycle of SM, populations can build quickly making crop rotation one of the most important management tools for growers. Because SM may survive in the soil for 2 or more years, avoid cole crops in a rotation or in nearby fields for 3 years. Planting in isolated locations or upwind from fields previously in brassicas can decrease the chance of infestations arriving by wind.</p> <p>Weed control - Brassica weeds such as shepherds purse, mustard, pennycress, wild radish, and yellow rocket are alternate hosts although swede midge prefers brassica crops to weeds.</p>",
                           'management_c': "Crop rotation - By the end of one field season, one pair of adult SM can result in approximately 86,000 larvae. The larvae will then over-winter in the soil and emerge next spring, resulting in more than 3 million larvae feeding on plants in the first generation. This life cycle means crop rotation should be one of the most important management tools for growers. SM may survive in the soil for 2 or more years; therefore, a crop rotation that does not include crucifer crops is essential. How far away does the field need to be? No one can be sure, but far enough (~ 1 to 2 km) to prevent the possibility of SM being carried into the field by a light wind. Without a host crop, the SM female will not be able to find a place to lay her eggs in her short 3-4 day life span. Planting in isolated areas, up from prevailing winds may help decrease the chance of spread. <p>Resistant varieties - Broccoli and gai lan (Chinese broccoli) are the most susceptible crops. Based on research in Canada, Paragon broccoli consistently sustains high levels of Swede midge damage. Eureka and Packman are also quite susceptible. Cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, Chinese cabbage, and red cabbage are also highly susceptible. Green cabbage appears somewhat less susceptible, but heavy infestations can cause severe damage.</p> <p>Site selection - Avoid planting in sheltered areas such as near trees, hedgerows, and buildings. Swede midge also prefer moist soils.</p> <p>Planting and harvest dates - Planting only early season crucifer crops is another control strategy to reduce damage levels and population growth. The amount of damage is directly related to the plant growth stage at the time of attack. The younger the plant the more severe the damage. As plants grow, damage becomes more evident. The first emergence of SM occurs at the end of May - beginning of June. Damage to early plantings will be less severe than to late plantings because the plant development will be advanced by mid-July when high populations occur. Harvesting of early season crucifers begins in July, which minimizes the amount of damage to the crop. Avoidance of late season crops will also help to reduce the size of the overwintering population in your fields. This strategy will not work for long season crucifer crops like Brussels sprouts.</p> <p>Weed control - Control cruciferous weed species such as wild mustard, shepherd's purse, pennycress and wild radish because they are hosts to Swede midge. Deep plowing of infested crop residue will help interrupt the insect's life cycle.</p>"},

                           'management_c': "Scouting - Swede midge injury is difficult to diagnose because there are similar abnormalities that can be caused by other factors including mechanical injury, insect and animal feeding, nutrient deficiencies, herbicide injury or heat or cold stress. To confirm injury is due to Swede midge feeding, the larvae should be dissected from the plant tissue. To scout, carefully examine young plants for unusual growth habits. The main growing point and any side shoots should be examined for damage and larvae. Brown, corky scarring is the key indication of the insect's feeding activity. In cabbage, it is easiest to find larvae prior to head development. Injury most commonly occurs at the borders of the field, especially near sheltered areas such as tree lines, so special attention should be paid to those areas. Plant parts suspected of infestation can be examined with a hand lens for the presence of larvae. Placing the growing tips in vials of alcohol or in plastic bags in the sun will force the larvae out of the tissue.
