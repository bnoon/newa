Examine plants at a minimum of ten randomly selected sites throughout the field. For fields less than 5 acres, examine two plants per site (20 plants total); for five to 25 acres, examine four plants per site (40 plants total); for each additional five acres, examine four plants at an additional site. Thresholds: treat when a localized infestation is found.</p> <p>If spraying is necessary choose from: Aza-Direct, AzaGuard, Azahar, AzaMax, Azatrol-EC, Ecozin Plus, Neemazad 1% EC, Neemix 4.5, Trilogy, PyGanic EC 5.0, Naturalis L, Garlic Barrier AG, PureSpray Green, Glacial Spray Fluid, Golden Pest Spray Oil, Saf-T-Side, SuffOil-X, M-Pede, SucraShield.</p> <p>Natural enemies - Naturally occurring predators, parasitoids, and pathogens help suppress aphid populations. Coleomegilla maculate, a lady beetle,  Chrysoperla carnea, the green lacewing, and Aphidoletes aphidimyza, the aphid midge are particularly helpful in reducing aphid populations although usually more effective for green peach aphid.  Predators tend to come in later in the season, after aphid populations are established making early control sometimes necessary. Increases in aphid infestations are often associated with applications of broad spectrum insecticides like pyrethrins that also kill natural enemies.
