'keychar_o':  "Fusarium yellows can attack all brassicas. The causal fungus enters mainly through the roots causing a sickly, dwarfed, yellow appearance and leaf drop, with vascular tissue browning the affected sides of leaves and plants. Leaves are often twisted, with one-sided yellowing. Oldest leaves are usually affected first. The disease is favored by hot and moist conditions and spread primarily by contaminated transplants, soil, or equipment moving from field to field.  Fusarium oxysporum has many strains, each of which specializes on a single crop or crop group.  Fields with a history of Fusarium on non-crucifer crops will not necessarily be a risk to crucifer crops.</p> <p><b>Relative risk: </b>Fusarium yellows was a severe problem in the past but is now largely controlled through the use of resistant varieties.  This disease can be severe in susceptible varieties when the pathogen is present in the soil.</p>",
