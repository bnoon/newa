'keychar_o':  "Also known as black leaf spot. Alternaria fungi most commonly cause leaf spotting but damping-off and damage to the flowers and seed can also occur. Leaf lesions begin as small black dots and enlarge to form target-like dark spots on the leaf or stem surfaces. Curds on cauliflower have sunken brown lesions whereas broccoli head lesions first appear as yellow. Spores are spread by wind and rain but rarely farther than adjacent fields. Infested seed is the main means of introduction. Lesions can provide an avenue for bacterial soft rot infections. Infections beginning in the greenhouse are amplified in the field. Flea beetles can spread this pathogen. </p><p><b>Relative risk: </b>This is the most common disease of cole crops but not necessarily the most destructive, depending on weather conditions. If transplants are clean and long rotations are used, this disease is unlikely to be serious.</p>",
