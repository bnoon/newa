'keychar_o':  "ICW overwinters in New York and is the most common Lepidoptera on cole crops in New York. ICW eggs are yellow, bullet-shaped, and are laid perpendicular to the underside of the leaf. Larvae grow to a length of 1&frac14; inch, are velvety green with a light yellow stripe running down their backs, and unlike the DBM, are sluggish if disturbed. Larvae begin feeding on the underside of leaves and then move to the marketable portions of the crop. The conspicuous white butterflies with 1 or 2 black spots on the wings fly from plant to plant during sunny days. Three generations per season are possible in the Northeast. </p> <p><b>Relative risk:</b> This is the most consistent insect pest of cabbage in New York and can cause considerable damage through chewing on the leaves and head and causing contamination in the marketable product.</p>",
