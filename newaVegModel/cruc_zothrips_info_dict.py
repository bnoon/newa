They cause rough, bronzed areas on leaves, especially the light-colored inner leaves. Adults survive on overwintering clover, alfalfa, and wheat rather than in onion or cabbage plant residues.</p> <p><b>Relative risk:</b> Infestations from onion thrips cause cosmetic damage to the leaves within mature heads of cabbage. Serious infestations make cabbage unmarketable. They are a consistent problem if growing susceptible cabbage varieties but are not normally a pest of broccoli, Brussels sprouts or cauliflower.</p>",

Even tolerant varieties may be injured during hot, dry summers. However, their injury will be far less than on more susceptible varieties. Information on the susceptibility of many varieties has been collected by Tony Shelton, Christy Hoepting and others and should be used as a guide in selecting more thrips tolerant varieties. <a href='http://www.nysaes.cals.cornell.edu/recommends/15cabbage.html' target='_blank'>Guidelines Table 15.1</a>. For susceptibility, see the table:<ul><li><a href='http://blogs.cce.cornell.edu/cvp/files/2009/06/relative-onion-thrips-damage-among-cabbage-varieties.pdf' target='_blank'>Relative Onion Thrips Damage Among Cabbage Varieties Table</a></li</ul> <p>Site selection - Onion thrips move from small grains to cabbage fields when the grain fields are harvested. Thrips sensitive varieties should not be planted near these fields.</p> <p>Planting - Thrips damage in some early storage varieties (100-115 days) may be reduced when transplants are planted in late June or early July.</p> <p>Weather - Thrips populations will be highest during hot, dry summers. Harvesting cabbage prior to its full maturity will decrease the injury that would normally occur. This can be a useful management strategy on very susceptible varieties.</p>",

NOTE: Our research has indicated that the most effective method for control of thrips on susceptible cabbage is to use a sidedress of imidacloprid 4-6 weeds after transplanting.  It may be necessary to follow followed up with foliar sprays of foliar spraysanother insecticide of acetamiprid from head formation until harvest.
