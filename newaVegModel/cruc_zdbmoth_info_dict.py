'keychar_o':  "The diamondback moth does not overwinter in upstate New York, but it may on Long Island in warm years. Small, round, yellowish-white eggs are laid singly or in groups of two or three on the underside of leaves or lower stalks. The yellow-green larvae are smaller than those of the cabbage looper or imported cabbage worm, ranging in size from about 1/16 to 1/4 inch, and are distinguished by active wriggling or dropping from the leaf on silk thread when disturbed. Larvae first mine into foliage and when older, feed on the undersides of leaves. Adult moths are small, dark gray/brown with distinguishing light colored triangular markings on the back. They are most active at dusk.</p> <p><b>Relative risk:</b> Diamondback moths damage foliage and cause contamination in the marketable products.  While sometimes a serious pest, its damage is variable on a yearly basis. Much of the problem originates from transplants grown in warmer areas.</p>",

However, varieties do have different levels of susceptibility and should be scouted separately.</p> <p>Site Selection - Do not plant near previously infested fields.</p> <p>Transplants - To prevent DBM from being introduced on transplants, inspect 100 transplants per shipment for the presence of DBM eggs, larvae, or pupae. If more than five percent of the transplants are infested, consider rejecting the load or applying a cleanup insecticide application using an insecticide from a different class than that used by the transplant grower.</p> <p>Trap cropping - Success in using trap crops to reduce larval damage has been variable. Yellow rocket has shown promise as a trap crop for diamondback moth in plantings of an acre or less.  It attracts moths to lay eggs, but inhibits larval development. Research suggests planting at least 20% of the field to the trap crop. Yellow rocket is not effective for other caterpillars. Research on trap cropping, especially using collards, has shown mixed results.</p> <p>Row covers - Floating row covers provide a barrier between the crop and pest, but can be expensive and may reduce crop yields.</p> <p>Weeds - Weeds in the brassica family, such as wild mustard, yellow rocket, and shepherds purse serve as alternate hosts for DBM and can contribute to a quick buildup of populations.</p>",
