'keychar_o':  "Cabbage root maggots overwinter as pupae and become active adults at about the same time as yellow rocket and forsythia are in bloom.  Larvae are small (&frac14; inch), white, legless, blunt-ended maggots. Larvae burrow into roots creating brown tunnels in roots and stems near the soil line, causing plants to wilt especially during high temperatures. The rarely seen adult looks similar to a house fly. Eggs are laid at the base of the plant in the soil.  There are 3 to 4 generations per year.</p> <p><b>Relative risk:</b> Cabbage maggot is a sporadic and sometimes very serious pest but can generally be controlled by the cultural methods recommended.</p>",

After planting seed, install row cover and seal edges. Yields of late plantings may be reduced by row covers. This method is only effective in fields where brassicas were not recently grown since row covers can act to trap emerging flies from the previous crop. Soil barriers prevent larvae from entering the soil. Place 5 to 6 inch circular barriers, made from dark colored felt or similar material, at the base of the stem. Adults lay eggs on the barriers where they dehydrate and die. Eggs can be monitored on dark colored barriers which contrast with the white eggs. Straw mulch also acts as a barrier to egg laying, but monitoring eggs is difficult.</p> <p>Weeds - Cabbage maggot populations can build on brassica weeds, especially wild mustards in and around the field. Control these weeds to reduce cabbage maggot incidence in subsequent plantings.</p>",

As a general guide for conditions around Ontario County, adults from the overwintering population first begin to emerge about May 1. After this spring emergence, another generation of adults will have its peak flight in mid to late June, another generation in the middle of August and a final generation in early September. Another general guideline for Ontario County for time of occurrence is to note the flowering period for some wild plants. Research has shown that Yellow Rocket roughly correlates with the first brood adult emergence, Day Lily with the second brood, Canada Thistle and Goldenrod with the third brood, and New England Aster with the fourth brood. Growers may want to apply an insecticide if planting occurs close to an adult peak. <p>If spraying is necessary choose from: Lorsban 15G, *Lorsban 4E, *Diazinon AG 500.</p> <p>Insecticide resistance management - A classification of insecticides based on their mode of action is available in pdf format.

During May and June, these temperatures will often be reached unless soil moisture is high due to rains. <p>Chinese cabbage is often attacked by a bacterial disease, soft rot, caused by the pathogen Erwinia carotovora. While entry of the pathogen can be caused by cultivation and other non-biological factors, cabbage and seed corn maggots can also be culprits. Injury first occurs on the white petioles at the base of the plant through an entry wound. Directed insecticide applications near the base will help prevent entry of the pathogen. Once infected, the disease will rapidly progress and cause the plants to degrade and smell terribly. Heavy soils tend to produce more soft rot due to their high water holding capacity compared to sandy, light textured soils; however, it can occur on both. Suggestions for reducing damage include: 1) grow for a spring/summer crop; 2) grow summer crops on raised beds and trickle irrigation to minimize the presence of free water; 3) carefully monitor for any insect or diseases that may compromise the plant and predispose it to infection by <i>E. carotovora.</i> </p>"},
